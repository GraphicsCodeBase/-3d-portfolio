    1 Hello! I am building a 3D web developer portfolio by following a YouTube tutorial.
    2
    3 My project is built with React, Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS. I've also installed and configured a
      the necessary libraries, including `react-router-dom`, `framer-motion`, `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, a
      `@react-three/drei`.
    4
    5 We have successfully completed the initial project setup and have a functioning Navbar component.
    6
    7 The very next step is to begin **Task #6: Implement the Hero section**, which will involve setting up th
      main 3D canvas and starting to build the 3D part of the portfolio.
