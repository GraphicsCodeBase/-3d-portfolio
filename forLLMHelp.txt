That is an excellent and very important question. Thinking about how to ask for help effectively is a skill
  in itself. Here’s a template you can use to give me, or any other AI assistant, the context needed to help
  you efficiently.

  Think of it as providing a good "bug report" or a "project briefing."

  How to Brief an AI Assistant on Your Project

  You can present the information in a few short paragraphs.

  1. Start with the High-Level Goal:
  Begin with a single sentence that describes the entire project.
  > "Hi, I'm building a 3D web developer portfolio by following a YouTube tutorial. The goal is to create a
  site with 3D models and animations."

  2. State Your Technology Stack:
  List the main technologies you're using. This is incredibly important.
  > "My project uses React with Vite, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Three.js / React Three Fiber for the 3D
  parts."

  3. Explain Where You Are in the Project:
  Describe the last thing you successfully completed. This helps the assistant understand your current
  position in the timeline.
  > "I have already set up the initial project, installed all the dependencies, and I'm currently working on
  building the Navbar component."

  4. Describe the Specific Problem:
  This is the most crucial part. Be as specific as possible.
   * What are you trying to do? ("I'm trying to make the navbar links turn blue when I hover over them.")
   * What did you expect to happen? ("I expected the text color to change.")
   * What happened instead? ("Nothing happens, and I see an error in my browser.")
   * Provide the EXACT error message. Copy and paste it directly.
      > "When I run npm run dev, I get this error: [Paste the full, exact error message here]"

  5. Provide the Relevant Code:
  Finally, paste the code from the file(s) you are working on. Don't send your entire project, just the
  relevant component or configuration file.
  > "Here is the code for my Navbar.jsx file:
  > `jsx
  > // ... paste your component code here ...
  > `
  > And here is my tailwind.config.cjs file:
  >
   1 > // ... paste your config code here ...
   2 > ```"

   6 If you provide these five pieces of information, any AI assistant will have a very clear picture of your
     project, your goal, and your problem, and will be able to help you much more effectively.

  For now, I have all this context. Shall we start on the first real task from our To-Do list: creating the
  project folders?
